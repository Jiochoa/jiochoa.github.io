          I'm a trained software engineer (SE) therefore most of my interests reside in that area. What specially interest me about Software Engineering is the security aspect, as it is extremely easy to disregard this part of most software specially when clients tend to ignore the implications of having a vulnerable system. Although, its not mainly their fault since the clients tend to be non-technical people who are more interested in a working product than a secure one.

          Another big interest of mine is in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Many knowledgeable people. such as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, have shown concern about Artificial Intelligence and I can see why. To put it in simple terms, there are some AI’s that are indistinguishable from a human mind and they keep improving. Some AI’s us game theory to achieve their goals and, depending on the AI, these goals could be malicious.

          As for non-technical interests, I also play guitar and piano on my free time. After a good day of coding I haven't been able to find a more soothing exercise than to get lost on my music and just play.
