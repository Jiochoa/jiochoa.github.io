        <p>
          Earned my master’s degree from the University of Texas at El Paso in 2020. 
          Since then, I’ve been working on my family’s business which involve managing 
          and maintaining an online store, while on the side, working on some projects 
          and ideas.   
        </p>
        <p>
          As a trained Software Engineer, most of my interests are in coding 
          and overall finding and making new tools that facilitate switching an idea 
          into code. What most interest me is the security aspect of programming, it is 
          extremely easy to disregard this aspect of software, specially when it is so 
          easy to ignore the implications of having a vulnerable system. For the most 
          part, most users are not at fault for being non-technical, they tend to be 
          mostly interested in a working product rather than a secure one. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As for non-technical interests, I also play piano and guitar on my free time. 
          After a good day of coding I haven't been able to find a more suitable exercise 
          than to get lost on music and just play.
