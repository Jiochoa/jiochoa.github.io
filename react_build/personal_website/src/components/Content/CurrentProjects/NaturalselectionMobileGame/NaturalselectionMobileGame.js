          Iâ€™m working on a mobile app dedicated to teach Darwinian Natural Selection in a fun way. The app will have you operating Nature as the main character and its objective is to eliminate the organisms that will keep popping up on the field.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea is to show the player how hard it is to eradicate living organisms when they evolve and adjust to the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game is still in the planning phase. Will post updates as they come. If you want to subscribe to updates you can subscribe to the mail list to receive updates.
